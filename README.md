# CS-VQE Ansatz Builder

Based on the foundational CS-VQE work of [https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-05-14-456/](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-05-14-456/), making use of the original code found at [https://github.com/wmkirby1/ContextualSubspaceVQE](https://github.com/wmkirby1/ContextualSubspaceVQE).

## What is included

- All of the original functionality of [ContextualSubspaceVQE](https://github.com/wmkirby1/ContextualSubspaceVQE);
- Qubit tapering funtionality making use of [Qiskit Nature](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/);
- Qubit conversion between Qiskit, OpenFermion and AQASM representations;
- Circuit class for constructing and executing CS-VQE Ansatz circuits;
