    "# Overview: circuit optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The *circuit optimization* part tackles some aspects of the problematic of adapting a quantum circuit to a specific hardware. This section explains, for instance, how the gate set of a circuit could be updated to deal with the constraints of a hardware, or how a circuit could be updated to be compliant with the topological constraints of a specific hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quantum Learning Machine provides tools to **optimize** and **compile** quantum circuits. Three main optimizers are already implemented in the QLM:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [**qat-nnize**](./satisfying_connectivity_constraints.ipynb): this tool solves the swap insertion problem on any circuit\n",
    " - **qat-pbo** ([low level optimization](./graph_circuit.ipynb) and [high-level optimization](./pattern_manager.ipynb)): this optimizer can replace patterns (i.e. small subcircuits) in a quantum circuit\n",
    " - [**qat-graphopt**](./graphopt.ipynb): specific optimization algorithm based on [**Automated optimization of large quantum circuits with continuous parameters**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07345) by Nam et al.\n",
    " - [**qat-synthopline**](./synthopline/overview.ipynb): a general purpose quantum circuit synthesis and optimization library. It contains various state-of-the-art synthesis algorithms and compilation tools."
