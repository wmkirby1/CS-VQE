    "\n",
    "This folder contains various tutorials describing the usage of the pyAQASM library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin:\n",
    "* this first [notebook](./writing_quantum_program.ipynb) shows how to write a simple circuit and display it\n",
    "* pyAQASM offers classical control and measure operations. [This notebook](./measurements_and_classic_operations.ipynb) presents these features.\n",
    "* All the basic features are summed up in a single [notebook.](py_aqasm.ipynb)\n",
    "* This [notebook.](./custom_gate_set.ipynb) presents how to construct custom gates in pyAQASM.\n",
    "* [this notebook](./qft.ipynb) presents an example of a QRoutine implementing a QFT\n",
    "* The gate set of pyAQASM is described in [this notebook](./available_gates.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms:\n",
    "* [this notebook](./needle_vs_haystack.ipynb) introduce a basic Quantum Search algorithm to look for clean coloration of a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced usage:\n",
    "* [this notebook](./gate_sets.ipynb) shows how to declare and use a custom gate set in pyAQASM.\n",
    "* [this notebook](./inlining_vs_not_inlining.ipynb) explains the inlining process that is happening when extracting a circuit\n",
    "* the ancillae management feature is presented [here](./advanced_usage_ancillae.ipynb).\n",
    "* the compute/uncompute scheme using `with` statements is described [here](./advanced_usage_compute_uncompute.ipynb)\n",
    "* [this notebook](./linking.ipynb) presents how to write and link circuit libraries in pyAQASM\n",
    "* [while this notebook](./very_advanced_linker.ipynb) goes even further and show how to link gate implementation under controlled operators\n",
    "* [this notebook](./quantum_types.ipynb) introduces the notion of quantum types and show how to generate powerful quantum oracles \n",
    "\n",
    "Text format:\n",
    "* [this notebook](./aqasm.ipynb) presents the AQASM text format"
