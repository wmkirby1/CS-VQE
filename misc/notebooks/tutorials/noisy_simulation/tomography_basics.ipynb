    "## Choosing a gate set, preparations and measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Tomography consists in using the QPU as a black box, with the only assumption that each quantum process, be it noise or a gate itself, acts as a linear map on the density matrix of the system. (One may also in addition assume that this map is trace-preserving and completely positive, but we will deal with these properties later on). To fully determine this matrix, one needs to prepare families of input states of rank at least the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space; similarly, one needs to determine the value of the projections of the final state on a family of independent measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the input states and the measurements, the user just has to specify lists of gate sequences ${F_j}_j$ and ${F'_i}_i$ such that the corresponding input states $F_j |\\rho_0\\gg$ and measurements $\\ll E| F'_i$ are *informationnally complete*, i.e are independent vectors in the Hilbert space. These two lists of gate sequences are sometimes called \"preparation fiducials\" and \"measurement fiducials\".\n",
